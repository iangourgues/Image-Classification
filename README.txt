Instructions:

Simply run each cell in JupyterLab to allow the AI to get a batch of images from the iterator, preprocess the data, train the data, and
plot the performance. When you arrive at the testing segment, there is a line of code that reads "IMG = cv2.imread('Man.jpg')" that
will take any given input .jpg file for the test. "Man.jpg" can be replaced with any given .jpg file for the test as long as it is located
in the Image Classification Project folder. After giving your input .jpg file, run the rest of the nodes to get the results.
